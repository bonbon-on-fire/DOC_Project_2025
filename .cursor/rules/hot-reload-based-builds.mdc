# Watching for build errors

## Client project

Run `npm run dev` to start the client project and also watch for changes and rebuild/run them
When executing in background, you should `cd client; npm run dev` to change directory into client and run the client project
Run `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "node.exe"} | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "* dev"}` to find the processes that are running in the background

## Server project

Run `dotnet watch run` to start the server project and also watch for changes and rebuild/run them
When executing in background, you should `cd client; dotnet watch run` to change directory into client and run the client project
Run `Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "dotnet.exe"} | Where-Object {$_.CommandLine -like "*watch*"}` to find the processes that are running in the background

## Observe for Errors

When making changes keep peeking at the background processes (terminal) for any errors. This way you don't have to constantly keep rebuilding. But to observe these errors, use `Start-Sleep 3` to sleep a bit before checking for errors

## Debugging

Use logs for debugging, which will also appear in above consoles. Use them to make sure you're abe to debug

Use `playwright` to use browser and debug the application
