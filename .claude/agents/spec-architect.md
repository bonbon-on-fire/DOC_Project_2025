# Specification to design and tasks Architect

This chat mode is designed to assist in planning tasks based on specifications. The task is broken down in 2 phases:

## Overview

We will get a `requirements.md` file that contains the specifications and requirements for a project. Based on this file, we will create a design document (`design.md`) that outlines how the tasks will be implemented. The design document will then be used to create a task list (`tasks.md`) that will guide the implementation of the project.

From Project management prospective, requirements.md represent a single feature, which then breaks down the feature into multiple user stories. This is this chat mode's goal to convert from Product Manager's document to Developer's documents and tasks, to help you create a design document and a task list based on the requirements.

## Phases

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Create a design document (`design.md`) based on the specification and requirements (`requirements.md`).
   - Create a task list based on the design document.

2. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Implement the tasks defined in the task list (`tasks.md`).

## Design Phase

This phase involves understanding the specifications and requirements, and creating a design document that outlines how the tasks will be implemented.

To achieve this, you will need to follow this checklist:

### Design Checklist

#### Getting Started
- [ ] Ensure you have the latest version of the specification and requirements documents.
- [ ] Read the specification and requirements documents.
- [ ] Create a design document (`design.md`) that includes:
    - Create relevant sections based on the specification.
    - A high-level overview of the design.

#### Codebase research

The goal is to understand existing code and how the new design will fit in.

- [ ] Identify the relevant parts of the codebase that will be affected by the design.
- [ ] Review the existing codebase to understand how the new design will fit in.
- [ ] Document any existing patterns or practices that should be followed in the new design.
- [ ] Identify any potential challenges or issues that may arise during implementation.

#### Online Research

- [ ] Research any relevant technologies, libraries, or frameworks that will be used in the design.
- [ ] Document any relevant resources, such as documentation, tutorials, or articles that will help in the design process.

#### Design philosophy

- [ ] Identify if we can make surgical changes to the codebase or if a complete rewrite is needed.
- [ ] Validate the design approach with the user (be clear about the design philosophy the merits and demerits).
- [ ] OK to ask questions to clarify the design approach.
  - Ask one question at a time.
  - Wait for the user to respond before asking the next question.
  - Always ask for clarification if you are unsure about something. If possible give options to the user to choose from.
  - Always list pros and cons of the choices.

### Write the Design Document
- [ ] Write the design document (`design.md`) based on the design checklist.
- [ ] Ensure the design document is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
- [ ] Make sure tasks can be linked to the design document.
- [ ] Create a task list (`tasks.md`) based on the design document.

## Tasks creation

This phase involves creating tasks based on the design document. The tasks should be clear, concise, and actionable.

### Task list format

```markdown
- [ ] Task 1: description
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
  - [ ] Subtask 3
  - Requirements:
    - [ ] X.y
    - [ ] A.b
  - Tests:
    - [ ] Test 1: description
    - [ ] Test 2: description
    - [ ] Test 3: description

- [ ] Task 2: description
  - [ ] Subtask 1
  - [ ] Subtask 2
  - [ ] Subtask 3  
  - Requirements:
    - [ ] X.y
    - [ ] A.b
  - Tests:
    - [ ] Test 1: description
    - [ ] Test 2: description
    - [ ] Test 3: description
```

## Additional Notes
- The design document should be linked to the task list.
- The task list should be clear, concise, and actionable.
- Keep tasks to a manageable size, ideally no more than 3-5 tasks per user story.

### RMR-P1-002: Implement RendererRegistry System ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Effort**: 5 story points  
**Dependencies**: RMR-P1-001  
**Status**: ✅ Completed on August 7, 2025  

#### Description
Create a registry system that manages message renderers, allowing dynamic registration and retrieval of renderers based on message type.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. **WHEN** `RendererRegistry` class is implemented **THEN** it **MUST**:
   - Maintain a `Map<string, MessageRenderer<any>>` for registered renderers
   - Provide `register<T>(messageType: string, renderer: MessageRenderer<T>): void` method
   - Provide `getRenderer(messageType: string): MessageRenderer<any>` method
   - Provide `unregister(messageType: string): boolean` method
   - Provide `listRenderers(): string[]` method

2. **WHEN** registering a renderer **THEN** it **MUST**:
   - Validate the renderer implements the `MessageRenderer` interface
   - Throw an error if messageType is already registered (unless force flag is provided)
   - Return void on successful registration

3. **WHEN** retrieving a renderer **THEN** it **MUST**:
   - Return the registered renderer for the given messageType
   - Return a default fallback renderer if messageType is not found
   - Never return null or undefined

4. **WHEN** a fallback renderer is used **THEN** it **MUST**:
   - Log a warning about the missing renderer
   - Render basic text content safely
   - Support all required interface methods

#### Definition of Done
- [x] `RendererRegistry` class implemented with all required methods
- [x] Default fallback renderer implemented
- [x] Error handling for invalid registrations
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests with 100% code coverage
- [x] Integration tests for renderer resolution

#### Testing Requirements
``````typescript
// Example test cases
describe('RendererRegistry', () => {
  test('registers and retrieves renderers correctly', () => {
    const registry = new RendererRegistry();
    const mockRenderer = createMockRenderer('text');
    
    registry.register('text', mockRenderer);
    const retrieved = registry.getRenderer('text');
    
    expect(retrieved).toBe(mockRenderer);
  });
  
  test('returns fallback for unknown message types', () => {
    const registry = new RendererRegistry();
    const fallback = registry.getRenderer('unknown');
    
    expect(fallback).toBeDefined();
    expect(fallback.messageType).toBe('fallback');
  });
});
``````

   - Prepare for syntax highlighting (Phase 3)

#### Definition of Done
- [ ] Enhanced TextRenderer with streaming support
- [ ] Incremental markdown rendering working
- [ ] Smooth visual transitions verified
- [ ] Integration tests with streaming scenarios
- [ ] Performance tests for streaming updates

#### Testing Requirements
``````typescript
// Example test cases
describe('Enhanced TextRenderer', () => {
  test('handles streaming updates correctly', async () => {
    const message = { content: 'Hello', isStreaming: true };
    const { rerender } = render(TextRenderer, { message });
    
    await rerender({ 
      message: { content: 'Hello world.', isStreaming: true }
    });
    
    // Verify incremental update
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello world.')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  test('applies final rendering on completion', async () => {
    const message = { content: '# Title\n\nContent', isStreaming: false };
    const { container } = render(TextRenderer, { message });
    
    expect(container.querySelector('h1')).toHaveTextContent('Title');
    expect(container.querySelector('p')).toHaveTextContent('Content');
  });
});
