# Repository Organization

## Overview

This repository is organized as a monorepo containing both the frontend (SvelteKit) and backend (ASP.NET 9.0) components of the AI Chat application, along with shared types and comprehensive documentation.

## Architecture Decisions

### Monorepo Approach

**Why we chose a monorepo:**
- **Unified Development**: Both frontend and backend can be developed and tested together
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript interfaces can be shared between client and server
- **Simplified CI/CD**: Single repository for deployment pipelines
- **Version Synchronization**: Client and server versions stay in sync
- **Code Reuse**: Shared utilities and constants across projects

### Technology Stack Rationale

#### Frontend: SvelteKit
- **Modern Framework**: Latest patterns with SSR/SPA capabilities
- **TypeScript Support**: Type-safe frontend development
- **Performance**: Fast runtime and excellent developer experience
- **Based on Proven Template**: Using sveltekit-ai-chatbot as foundation

#### Backend: ASP.NET 9.0
- **Enterprise Grade**: Robust, scalable, and well-supported
- **Real-time Capabilities**: SignalR for streaming AI responses
- **Type Safety**: C# provides strong typing throughout the stack
- **Performance**: Excellent performance characteristics
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem for databases, authentication, etc.

#### Shared Types
- **Type Safety**: Ensures API contracts are maintained
- **Developer Experience**: IDE support for autocompletion and error checking
- **Reduced Bugs**: Compile-time validation of API interactions
- **Documentation**: Types serve as living documentation

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Use Docker Compose for local development: `docker-compose up`
3. Or run each service manually:
   - Client: `cd client && npm install && npm run dev`
   - Server: `cd server && dotnet restore && dotnet run`

### Development Guidelines
- **Type Safety**: Always use TypeScript interfaces from `shared/types/`
- **API Contracts**: Update shared types when changing API endpoints
- **Documentation**: Update relevant docs when making architectural changes
- **Testing**: Write tests for both frontend and backend components
- **Linting**: Follow established code formatting and linting rules

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Docker Compose with hot reload
- **Staging**: Containerized deployment with production-like settings
- **Production**: Separate deployment of client (Vercel/Netlify) and server (Azure/AWS)

## Benefits of This Organization

1. **Clear Separation**: Each component has a well-defined purpose and scope
2. **Shared Resources**: Common types and utilities prevent duplication
3. **Scalability**: Easy to add new services or frontend applications
4. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes navigation and updates easier
5. **Documentation**: Self-documenting through structure and dedicated docs
6. **Development Speed**: Streamlined setup and shared tooling

## Future Considerations

- **Microservices**: The server directory can be split into multiple services as needed
- **Mobile Apps**: Additional client applications can be added alongside the web client
- **Shared Libraries**: The shared directory can be extended with more common utilities
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Dedicated testing directories and configurations
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions or similar for automated testing and deployment

This organization provides a solid foundation for building and scaling the AI Chat application while maintaining code quality and developer productivity.
