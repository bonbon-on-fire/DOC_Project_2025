# Specification Planning Checklist: Manual CRUD Storage

- [ ] Getting started
  - [ ] Create a checklist in ScratchPad to track progress of the specification writing. Make sure to include the following items in the checklist:
    - [ ] Collect high-level requirements
    - [ ] Research for existing solutions / technologies / documentation
    - [ ] Understand current implementation
    - [ ] Search online for relevant technologies and documentation
    - [ ] Gather user expectations
    - [ ] Decide if need to loop again

- [ ] Collect high-level requirements
  - [ ] Ask user about the high-level requirements of the feature or system.
  - [ ] Understand the purpose of the feature or system.

- [ ] Research for existing solutions / technologies / documentation
  - [ ] Search online for existing solutions or similar features.
  - [ ] Look for existing solutions or similar features in the codebase.
  - [ ] Research online for similar features or systems.

- [ ] Understand current implementation
  - [ ] Look at the current implementation of the feature or system.
  - [ ] Identify the components involved in the current implementation.

- [ ] Search online for relevant technologies and documentation
  - [ ] Search for relevant technologies, libraries, or frameworks that can be used in the implementation.
  - [ ] Look for documentation or resources that can help in understanding the feature or system.
  - [ ] Look for design patterns or best practices that can be applied.

- [ ] Gather user expectations
  - [ ] Ask user about their expectations from the feature or system.
  - [ ] Understand the user experience they are looking for.
  - [ ] Refine the requirements based on user feedback.

- [ ] Decide if need to loop again
  - [ ] Check if the specification is complete.
  - [ ] If not complete, create a new checklist item to gather more information and start the loop again.
    - New checklist may only include items that are not yet complete.
    - should normally be smaller than the previous checklist.

- [ ] Write the specification document
  - [ ] Figure out the feature name and create an appropriate directory in the docs/features folder.
  - [ ] Organize the specification document in a clear and structured manner, save it in `docs/features/{feature_name}/requirements.md`.
  - [ ] Include sections for high-level requirements, existing solutions, current implementation, user expectations, and detailed specifications.
  - [ ] Each requirement should have a clear description, acceptance criteria, and any relevant links or references.
